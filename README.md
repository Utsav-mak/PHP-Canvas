# PHP-Canvas

This is my first PHP project which is sort of a full-stack project which I had to do as a part of a university subject.

In this project, A user can log in, log out, and the user will be logged out after 10 minutes if activity. 
This projects uses concepts such as connecting to database, entering information in the database, authentication from MySql dta, cookies and sessions.


As this was my first project it took a lot of debugging for me. But in the end I was able to finish it.

For instance, it took me this much research and debugging to complete this project.
